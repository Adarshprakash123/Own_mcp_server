## ðŸ§  MCP Architecture Overview

This project uses the **MCP (Multi-Component Platform)** system to modularly manage tools, context, and prompts across servers, clients, and host agents. Below is a complete breakdown of how the components interact.

### ðŸ“¦ Key Components

| Component     | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **MCP Server**  | Stores shared tools, context (memory), and prompt templates. It does **not execute** tools. |
| **MCP Client**  | Lives inside the Host App. Connects to MCP Server and **pulls in** tools, context, and prompts. |
| **Host App**    | The actual app that runs the **agent**, handles user interaction, and **executes tools** received via MCP Client. |
